## Michael Stapelbergs Website

I use computers for fun and profit. In my spare time, I participate in the Free
and open-source software community.

I wrote the Linux tiling window manager [i3](https://i3wm.org/), the code
search engine [Debian Code Search](https://codesearch.debian.net/) and the
netsplit-free, distributed IRC network [RobustIRC](https://robustirc.net/).

Sometimes I dabble in electronics, for example with
[freetserv](https://freetserv.github.io/), my open hardware serial terminal
server, or [kinX](/posts/2018-04-17-kinx/), a low-latency replacement keyboard
controller for Kinesis keyboards.

In [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian), I maintain a bunch of
packages and services.

My early adoptions are IPv6 and HiDPI, so I contributed patches to numerous
programs (chromium, apt, radvd, vsftpd, etc.)

I sometimes give [talks](/talks).

To email me, replace the first dot with an @ symbol in this siteâ€™s domain. If
