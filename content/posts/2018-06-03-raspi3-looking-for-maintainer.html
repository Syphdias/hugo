  <strong>This is taken care of: Gunnar Wolf has taken on maintenance of the Raspberry Pi image. Thank you!</strong>
</p>

<p>
  (Cross-posting this message I sent to pkg-raspi-maintainers for broader visibility.)
</p>

<p>
  I started building Raspberry Pi images because I thought there should be an easy, official way to install Debian on the Raspberry Pi.
</p>

<p>
  I still believe that, but I’m not actually using Debian on any of my Raspberry Pis anymore¹, so my personal motivation to do any work on the images is gone.
</p>

<p>
  On top of that, I realize that my commitments exceed my spare time capacity, so I need to get rid of responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, <strong>I’m looking for someone to take up maintainership of the Raspberry Pi images</strong>. Numerous people have reached out to me with thank you notes and questions, so I think the user interest is there. Also, I’ll be happy to answer any questions that you might have and that I can easily answer. Please reply here (or in private) if you’re interested.
</p>

<p>
  If I can’t find someone within the next 7 days, I’ll put up an announcement message in the raspi3-image-spec README, wiki page, and my blog posts, stating that the image is unmaintained and looking for a new maintainer.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for your understanding,
</p>
