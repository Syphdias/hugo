<p>
I’ve been travelling a bit to foreign countries lately and noticed that all of
the places I’ve stayed at (low to medium price range hotels) have one thing in
common: their WiFi is absolutely horrible.
</p>

<p>
Even worse, it seems like the more money you pay, the more horrible the WiFi
gets. As an example, I’ve stayed at the NH city centre in Amsterdam recently.
Curiously, swisscom runs the WiFi there — I didn’t even know they do more than
access and mobile network in Switzerland. We booked a double room (so the hotel
knew there are two people staying in the room), but swisscom only allows one
login. I’ll repeat: one (1) login. In 2014. Where people travel with
smartphones, tablets and notebooks. Per person. Even better: every time you
lose connection, you need to re-acknowledge the terms of service. Of course
this breaks automated updates of Android smartphones because they try to save
battery and connect to the WiFi only sporadically.
</p>

<p>
Not only with swisscom it frequently happens that WiFi providers offer you
laughably low volume limits like 100 MiB, which is less than what I have
with my tiny international roaming package. Or 256 kbit/s (!) of bandwidth,
which of course is no comparison to mobile data connections these days. Also,
I’ve seen latencies as high as half a minute, effectively preventing any
internet usage from working.

<h2>The horrible WiFi PDF</h2>

<p>
In order to not suffer in silence any more, but quickly express my frustration,
I’ve created a form that I’ll carry with me when visiting a hotel. In case
(hah!) their WiFi sucks, I can just leave them that note and hope they’ll
eventually take action.

Feel free to do the same: store <a href="/horrible-wifi.pdf">horrible-wifi.pdf (19
KiB)</a> (Public Domain, please share) and leave it at every hotel with
inacceptable WiFi.
