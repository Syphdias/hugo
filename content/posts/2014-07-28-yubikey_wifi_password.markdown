<p>
In my flat, I have a printed <a
href="http://daniel-baumann.ch/other/qr-codes/wifi/">QR code which contains the
WiFi credentials</a>. You can scan it with your Smartphone (provided you have a
barcode scanner installed) and then connect to the WiFi network.
</p>

<p>
For notebook computers, this doesn’t work so well. Sometimes they don’t have a
usable camera, and even if they have one, people don’t typically have a barcode
scanner installed.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, you typically end up typing in the (long) password, which is
annoying. I thought there should be a better way, perhaps by faking a USB Human
Interface Device (like a keyboard). Then I saw a YubiKey lying around and a
couple minutes later I had my solution working :-).
</p>

<h2>YubiKey</h2>

<p>
The <a
href="http://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey/">YubiKey</a> is
a small USB device (about as big as a USB memory stick) that is typically used
for two-factor authentication. You may be familiar with this concept from
Gmail, where you log in with a password and then provide a number generated by
the Google Authenticator on your phone as a second factor. The YubiKey does
this by simulating you typing in the number after you touch it.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, the device’s firmware also supports a mode where it essentially just
types a static password when being touched. Unfortunately, this feature is a
bit hard to use, so I wrote <a
href="https://github.com/stapelberg/pw-to-yubi">pw-to-yubi</a>, a little script
which translates a (WiFi) password into a command line to program your YubiKey.
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install yubikey-personalization
$ git clone https://github.com/stapelberg/pw-to-yubi.git
$ cd pw-to-yubi
$ ./pw-to-yubi.pl mywifipassword
ykpersonalize -1 -o-append-cr -o-static-ticket -oshort-ticket \
  -o-strong-pw1 -o-strong-pw2 -oman-update \
  -ofixed=h:101c1a0c090c130416161a1215070000 -ouid=000000000000 \
  -a00000000000000000000000000000000
</pre>

<p>
Run the command and any further touches of the YubiKey that is currently
plugged into your computer will result in the key typing your WiFi password.
